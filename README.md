UI/UX Design Planning
üß≠ Design Goals
The UI/UX design of this Airbnb clone focuses on simplicity, responsiveness, and intuitive navigation. The goal is to provide users with a seamless experience whether they are browsing, listing, or booking a property. Key design principles include:

Clean and minimal layout with clear call-to-actions

Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

Fast-loading components with smooth transitions

Accessibility and readability

üóù Key Features to Implement
Interactive search bar with location autocomplete

Listing cards with images, pricing, ratings, and brief descriptions

Calendar-based availability and booking system

Secure login/signup flow with error handling

Intuitive property upload form for hosts

Clear feedback on actions (bookings, errors, confirmations)

Core Pages
Page	Description
Property Listing View	A grid-based layout displaying all available listings with filters for location, price, and date. Each card contains an image, title, price per night, and a rating.
Listing Detailed View	A single property view showing full images, description, amenities, reviews, availability calendar, and a ‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù button.
Simple Checkout View	A streamlined page where users confirm their stay, view total pricing, input payment details (mock), and receive booking confirmation.

Why User-Friendly Design Matters
A booking system must feel trustworthy, easy to navigate, and responsive. Poor UX can lead to user frustration, abandoned bookings, and lost engagement. A clear, user-friendly design ensures that:

Users feel confident entering personal and payment information.

Hosts can easily manage listings without needing technical skills.

Navigation and actions (like booking) are clear, fast, and error-free.

The overall experience aligns with user expectations from modern travel platforms.

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) & Render/Heroku (Backend)

Optional Add-ons: Cloudinary (for image uploads), Mapbox or Google Maps API (for location)
